# Golf Leaderboard Generator

Tool to generate a custom Masters-style golf leader-board PNG image with user-defined data.

Currently supports scores of -10 -> +9 and requires that the user has the Bahnschrift font installed (e.g. you probably need to be a windows user to get the correct fonts)

Play around with it [here](https://bufobufogames.github.io/Golf_Leaderboard_Generator/).
